Lets understand this Call app

basicaly in this app  we have 2 containers or main sections
    .form-container
        it contains form which take input from the user
        inputs like
            1. image url
            2. fullname
            3. hometown
            4. purpose of Call
            5. category     
                emergency
                important
                urgent
                no-rush
            
            then we have a submit button
        and outside form tag we have a close btn which will close the form

    .note-container
        in this note container we have 3 sections 
        .left nav icons
            which contains 
                .addnote - which will open the form 
                .upbtn - to scroll up in the card
                .downbtn - to scroll down in the card
        .stack
            this will be having out cards of recorded call list

            under this the card will be added dynamicaly so will not write this cards in html but this is the structure used here
                we have card div
                    .under which we have avatar img which will be showing user image which we have asked in form img url
                    .then we have name h2 
                    .home town info div
                        which contain a label and value span
                    .bookings Info div
                        which also contain label and value span
                    .button div
                        msg btn and call btn 
                    
                this card will be added to stack class element


        .right-colors
            and we have some color circles which is black, purple, orange, teal


#####################################################################################

now lets begin will JS part how and what we are doing

    we will be selecting the elements

1. we are working to open form on clicking add-note (+) btn in the note container in the note-container class

    - we create a varible and store the selected add-note id element
    - select the form-container div also
    - we will add a eventlistener to add-note btn on click 
        in the function we will give the form container display initial because in css we have already given it display none so on btn click form will open.
    
2. now we work on closing the form on clicking the close btn in the form container.
     
     - first we will select the close form btn and 
     - add a eventlistener to the btn on click 
     - and in the function we will give form-container to display none again to hide it.

3. now we will work on form inputs and validations

    - first selecting all input fields 
    - add event listener to form on submit
    - in function 
        1. prevent the default behaviour of the form so that on submit it don't refresh
        2. then we begin will adding validator so that fields are not empty

4. we work on category radios 

    - creating selected variable as false
    - and then on category radios apply the foreach loop to triverse b/w each sub options
    under the function take a paramenter category/cat
        you can check using console.log or .dir the cat

        if that cat is checked then select category value associated with that selected category

        if not then alert the user to select category to proceed


5. now we will work on saving the data into the local storage 

    for this we will create a function to save to local storage which will take a "obj" 
        - under this we will check if localStorage with the key task is null or not if it is 
           . then we will create a empty array named as old tasks
            and add the "obj" to the end of the array
            .then we will add the tasks key to local storage with the value of old tasks but in stringified structure so it store it as a obj not as a stringified
        - else 
            .we will create a old task variable and give it the value of task key in the localStorage which already exist
            . and store parsed value of that old task into old tasks variable
            and add the obj to the oldtask array.
            . then again we will set the task key with updated old tasks data in a stringified way.

    then we will call the function with parameter of obj with imgurl, fullname, pourpose, hometown, selected
    

    - after submit we want to reset the form to empty 

    - then will display none to form container

    and call showcards function

6. now we will write addCards function with the value of each card 
    basicaly adding the cards dynamicaly in stack


7. now we will work on the upbtn and down btn next to the card which will scroll to next card element

    - we will add upbtn a eventlistener on click and 
    - in the function we will 
        create a variable lastchild which will be storing the lastelementchild of stack
        -if lastchild is true
            in stack we will use insertbefore with parameter of last child which need to added before the fist element child of stack
            then we will class the update stack function.

    -now we will add eventlistener to down btn on click 
        in the function
        we will create a variable first child giving it the value of first element child of stack
        if firstChild is true 
            we will append child the firstChild

THIS IS A BIT CONFUSING SO WILL ASK GPT FOR EXPLAIN BETTER

8. now we will write updatestack function

        we will create a variable storing the selected card in the stack class
         
        here we will use foreach to go to each card and 
        ok we didnot used foreach bcoz we did not wanted to do this for all cards but the top 3 cards so we will use for loop normal for loop



            in the function taking the card and index as two parameters
                we will give the z index to the card = 3 - index 
                bcoz we are showing just 3  cards using css

                next we will transform the card and translateY by index* 10 px and scale 1-index * 0.02

                update card opacity = 1- index * 0.02
