In this project we are making a text input under which when user enter the name of the user the user cards will filter out the users from the array of users.

To begin 
what we want - show users, 
                filter by user input    
                show filtered users
            

firstly we will create a variable storing array of objects containing the user details like name pic url and bio 

then we will create a function to showuser which will take an array as an argument

    under this fuction we will iterate every object containing user info 
        and write a function with a parameter of user
            now we will create a card variable under which we will be dynamicaly creating card Element 

            it is something like

            div.card
                img src=" the value of pic from the users array class= bg-img

                div.blurred-layer and set background img as user pic from the array

                then will create a div.contains which will he contining h3 and para

                h3 and p will be given text from the array h3 for name and p for bio of the user.

            by writing this now we have seperate cards for each user now.

        after this we will add each element inside its main content the append that at its specific place after all the main card is appended to the cards div element in the html

now we will call this function() and we have all the cards created for each user



now the logic 

declare a variable and selecct the element input filtered

add eventlistener to this input and in the function part 
    
    create a new variable and under this filter the user where the input text is matching with the user name 

now we will select the cards div and give it inner html space value 

now we will call our function and pass the parameter we created above which store the filtered users. 

also we had a home work to work on no user found when there is no such user.
which i will be creating when i am done with above program
